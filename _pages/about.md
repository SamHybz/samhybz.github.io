My name is Samuel Hybois, I am an associate professor at the [Faculty of Sports Science (STAPS), Universit√© Paris-Saclay](https://www.faculte-sciences-sport.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), doing my research in the [CIAMS laboratory, MHAPS team](https://www.faculte-sciences-sport.universite-paris-saclay.fr/recherche/presentation-unite-de-recherche-ciams). 

My research activities focus on using musculoskeletal modelling and measurement tools (motion capture, video, IMUs, etc.) to analyse movement in multiple contexts, that can range from tennis forehand drives to daily-life situations (walking with impairments, manual wheelchair locomotion).

### Ongoing research projects

üë£ **Functional evaluation of children with idiopathic scoliosis by integrating musculoskeletal modelling and markerless motion capture** Supervision of the PhD of C√©lia Dendale, in collaboration with H√©l√®ne Pillet-Goujon (IBHGC) and Anne-Laure Simon (H√¥pital Robert Debr√©).

ü¶ï **How did ornithopods walk?** With the [DINOSIM](https://www.pamir.fr/projets-soutenus/dinosim/) project, we are combining the tools of paleontology and biomechanics/musculoskeletal modelling to investigate the locomotor behavior of dinosaurs. 

üéæ **Evaluating the impact of stances for tennis forehand drives.** 
With my colleagues C√©line Triolet and Caroline Teulier, we are working on the biomechanical evaluation of the type of stances and its impact on performance. 

üö∏ **Using biomechanics and motion capture to evaluate the motor development of children**
